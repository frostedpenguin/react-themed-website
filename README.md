## Introduction
This was one of the assignments I did for my subject in web technology.
The goal of the exercise was to make a responsive and interactive 
website in a theme of our choice. I had just started learning react at that
time, so I decided to try and copy their UI and make that the theme of the website.
## What did I implement
I learned a lot of the basics in this assignment. Stuff like;
* usage of appropriate HTML tags
* usage of CSS rules
* usage of CSS Grid and Flex box
* usage of media queries and image sets for responsivity purposes
* basic javaScript for interactivity purposes

## Installation
If you want to try your project your self clone it and open the index.html
